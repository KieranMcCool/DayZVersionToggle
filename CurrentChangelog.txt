We're now moving the Steam app manifests around to fix the issue some people had with steam updating DayZ constantly.
Program now waits asynchronously for the game to end (It wont appear unresponsive anymore, that was just me being lazy before :P) 
Moved some code around to make it a bit more readable and have greater separation of concerns.
Added a settings window which will allow you to recover a broken installation.
